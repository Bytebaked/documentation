# Why can't I connect to the server when it says it's running?

## The server has not yet finished starting up
The game server process is considered to be running when it starts, but this does not mean that the server has finished starting. For example, plugins or mods may not be loaded yet, and maps may not be created yet. At this point, you cannot connect to the game.
